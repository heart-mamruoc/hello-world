step 1
Create "..a repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs..."
Step 2. Create a Branch
      Here at GitHub, our developers, writers, and designers use branches for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from our master       (production) branch. When a change is ready, they merge their branch into master.
      
       On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a        particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve          done and why.
